            Hi, my name is <b>Saloni Angre</b> and I am Seattle.
            I'm a <b>Software Engineer</b> currently pursuing my <b>Master’s in Information Systems</b>. <br/><br/>
            I hold a Bachelor's in Information Technology and have hands-on experience in backend development, ML research, and API integration. Previously, I worked as a <b>Software Engineer at LTIMindtree</b> My curiosity for intelligent systems led me to complete two machine learning research internships, where I applied ML techniques to hardware signal analysis, circuit fault prediction, and large language model tuning.
            Outside of work, I’m a strong believer in building with purpose and creativity. You can find some of my technical and research projects in the Projects section.<br/><br/>
            I am <b>open</b> to new collaborations or work where I can contribute and grow. Feel free to connect with me, links are in the footer.<br/>
            Apart from coding I love to do Travel. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/saloniangre/" target='_blank'>Linkedin.</a>
